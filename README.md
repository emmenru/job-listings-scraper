 Scraper to retrieve job listings from Indeed

scrape-countries : Script to scrape currently available data from job listnings on Indeed based on job title and city, with default settings for search filters (e.g. not sorted by date posted or "remote" only). Please note that there are some differences in terms of filtering properties available for different countries. Tips and tricks: make sure the machine does not go into sleep mode while running the code, since that might disrupt the connection. Requests can be made smaller if this is an issue (e.g. fewer job title keywords or cities).
