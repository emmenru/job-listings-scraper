 MEDICAL:  SCRRA offers a choice of twelve (12) health plan options provided through the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). You may choose from up to ten (10) Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans and two (2) Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans. Some health plans are only available in certain counties and/or zip codes.     You contribute 12.5 percent of the plan premium for coverage of you and your eligible dependents.    You may waive coverage if you are covered under another group health plan; you must provide proof. Once you waive coverage, you will only be allowed to enroll during Open Enrollment or within 60 days from the date on which your other coverage is no longer available (proof is required). If you elect to waive coverage, you will receive $300.00 per month taxable earnings, paid in two installments of $150 each on the first two paychecks of the month. A retiree or an employee who is a spouse, child, or any other eligible dependent of another SCRRA employee is not eligible for the opt out/cash in lieu credit if he/she is covered under a SCRRA health plan.    Eligibility begins the first of the month following hire date or qualifying event.     DENTAL:  SCRRA offers two dental options provided by Delta Dental. Under the DeltaCare (HMO) program, you must select a contract dentist within their network to perform your dental services. If you require treatment from a specialist, your contract dentist will handle the referral. Many services are covered at no cost to you. A co-payment applies for other services.     The Delta Dental PPO plan allows you to visit a dentist of your choice, change dentists at any time, go to a dental specialist of your choice, receive dental care anywhere in the world, and save on out-of-pocket expenses when you visit a PPO network dental office.    SCRRA pays the full premium for coverage of you and your eligible dependents under both plans.    Eligibility begins the first of the month following hire date or qualifying event.     VISION:  SCRRA offers two (2) vision plans through Vision Service Plan (VSP), providing coverage for eye examinations, prescription eyewear and contact lenses through network providers. You have the option of seeing out-of-network providers, but full reimbursement is not guaranteed.    VSP has contracted with many laser surgery facilities and doctors, offering you a discount on PRK and LASIK surgeries.    If you enroll in the VSP Basic Plan, SCRRA pays the full premium for coverage of you and your eligible dependents. If you enroll in the VSP Buy-up Plan, which offers enhanced vision benefits, you pay the difference between the cost of the Basic Plan and the Buy-up Plan.    Eligibility begins the first of the month following hire date or qualifying event.     FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS:  Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) allow for the deferral of pre-tax dollars to be used for reimbursement of eligible medical and dependent care expenses.

IRS regulations require that the portion of Group Term Life (“G.T.L.”) insurance benefits provided to you by SCRRA, which exceeds $50,000, be added to your Federal, State, and Medicare taxable earnings for W-2 reporting. This amount is reflected on your pay statements each pay period in the “Other Benefits and Information” section.    In addition, SCRRA offers a voluntary plan, which may be purchased in increments of $10,000 to a maximum of $100,000 without evidence of insurability (initial enrollment period only) and up to 5 times your salary to a maximum of $500,000 with evidence of insurability.

HEALTH ADVOCACY SERVICES:   SCRRA offers you and your eligible dependents free health advocacy services through Health Advocate. You are entitled to unlimited calls with trained professionals who can help you navigate the healthcare and insurance systems.     RETIREMENT PLAN:  The SCRRA contracts with the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). You pay a 7.00 percent employee contribution and SCRRA pays an employer contribution, which varies each year. To be eligible for service retirement, you must be at least age 52 and have a minimum of five (5) years of CalPERS-credited service. Upon retirement you are entitled to a monthly retirement benefit based on your years of credited service, age, and average compensation during your last three (3) years of service (“final compensation”). The retirement formula for New Members is 2%@62, which means at age 62, you receive 2 percent of your final compensation for every year of service.    Upon separation from employment with less than 5 years of credited service, you may request a refund of your employee contributions only, including interest, and end your membership with CalPERS, or leave it in your account and retain your service credit should you decide to work for another CalPERS-covered agency. If you are vested upon separation but do not retire, you may leave your contributions in your account until retirement or elect a refund.     SOCIAL SECURITY:  You do not participate in Social Security except for Medicare. You will contribute 1.45 percent of your pay to cover the hospital insurance portion of Medicare.   
 
 Additional Medicare Hospital Insurance Tax:  As of January 1, 2013, employees are required to pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax on earnings above $200,000 (for those who file an individual return) or $250,000 (for those who file a joint return). This additional hospital insurance tax is not reflected in the rate above. 
     RETIREE MEDICAL:  Unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18*: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other. SCRRA pays the same amount for retirees as it does for active employees, which is currently 87.5 percent of the applicable premium.    Unrepresented employees hired on or after 11/1/18: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other and you have a minimum of 10 years of credited CalPERS service, five of which must be performed at SCRRA. SCRRA pays a percentage of the state annuitant contribution rate** in accordance with the vesting schedule below:    10 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%  11 – 19 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%, plus 5% for each additional year of service  20+ Years of CalPERS Service - 100%   
 
 Once each year the employer may allow unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18 the opportunity to individually elect to be subject to the vesting schedule. 
  **The state annuitant contribution rates for 2023 are: $883 (Retiree Only); $1,699 (Retiree + 1 Dependent); $2,124 (Retiree + Family).     DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (457) :  You are eligible to set aside a portion of your current income without paying taxes on that money until it is received later during retirement when taxes may be lower. In 2023, you can defer up to 100 percent of your gross compensation or $22,500 annually, whichever is less (“normal contribution limit”). You may make an additional $7,500 contribution to the plan if you are age 50 and older. If you are at least within three years of the age in which you are eligible to receive unreduced benefits under our CalPERS retirement plan, you may contribute up to double the normal contribution limit, or $45,000.     TRANSPORTATION PASSES:  You may use your employee badge for unlimited free access to all Metrolink lines and trains. Your badge cannot be used on connecting public transportation. However, if you commute to/from work on Metrolink on a regular basis and need to connect to other public transportation (e.g., Metro Red or Purple Line) you can be issued a Metrolink pass with the appropriate station pair, which will also give you access to connecting transportation.    You are also eligible to receive a free transit pass to ride any greater Los Angeles area transit system other than Metrolink (such as, Metro, Foothill Transit, LADOT, and LOSSAN) for commuting purposes. The commuter transit pass has a value up to the monthly maximum tax-free transit pass amount established by the Internal Revenue Service ($300 in 2023). You are responsible for any transit fares above the IRS monthly cap. To receive this benefit, the SCRRA requires each employee to use public transportation to commute to and from work three (3) or more days per week.

  About Hiscox
  
 
 
  As an international specialist insurer we are far removed from the world of mass market insurance products. Instead we are selective and focus on our key areas of expertise and strength - all of which is underpinned by a culture that encourages us to challenge convention and always look for a better way of doing things.
  
 
 
  We insure the unique and the interesting. And we search for the same when it comes to talented people. Hiscox is full of smart, reliable human beings that look out for customers and each other. We believe in doing the right thing, making good and rebuilding when things go wrong. Everyone is encouraged to think creatively, challenge the status quo and look for solutions.
  
 
 
  Scratch beneath the surface and you will find a business that is solid, but slightly contrary. We like to do things differently and constantly seek to evolve. We might have been around for a long time (our roots go back to 1901), but we are young in many ways, ambitious and going places. Some people might say insurance is dull, but life at Hiscox is anything but. If that sounds good to you, get in touch.
