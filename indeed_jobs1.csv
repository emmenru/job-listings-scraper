 More About Propel 
 We believe that Americans with limited income deserve modern, respectful, and effective experiences around their government benefits and money. Unfortunately, the status quo often fails to treat them as first-class citizens in their daily interactions around the social safety net and financial services. The tech industry hasn't pulled its weight in solving the problems faced by low-income Americans. 
 Propel's mission is to change that. We've built Providers, the single most popular app in the country built specifically for low-income Americans. Over 5 million families each month use Providers to seamlessly manage their government benefits (programs like SNAP, commonly known as food stamps), conduct their banking, and save and earn money. Providers has been recognized by the White House, featured on the front page of the NYTimes, and carries over 500,000 five star reviews. 
 Propel is a for-profit, venture-backed start-up company that holds its social mission at its core. We're proud to be supported by a blend of nonprofits, impact investors, and world-class investors, including the Robin Hood Foundation, Andreessen Horowitz, Nyca Partners, Financial Health Network, JPMorganChase, Kevin Durant, Serena Williams, and Nas. For us to build a self-sustaining and profitable business, we need to deeply understand our user's needs and build multiple successful products addressing those needs. If this challenge appeals to you, we'd love to talk! 
  Join us, and let's build something amazing together!"
